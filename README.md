# Mini Shell in C!

## What is this?
- This is a mini shell in C, made using the Stephen Brennan tutorial
- The project was made purely from a learning standpoint to get a good feel of some system level concepts.

## How do I use it?
- Just clone the repo, compile the programs using the following instructions, and run:

```bash
gcc main.c -o main
```

### Any suggestions are welcome
